# ── Experiment ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The name of your experiment folder. Must be in the same directory as the
# .py files. Include spaces and special characters exactly as they appear.
EXPERIMENT = 'your_experiment_folder'


# ── m/z Range ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Features outside this range are removed before any analysis.
# Default reflects the informative range for fungal metabolomics on a SCIEX 4500.
# Adjust to match the range where your instrument produces reliable signal.
MZ_MIN = 100   # lower m/z cutoff (Da)
MZ_MAX = 1000  # upper m/z cutoff (Da)


# ── Binning ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Groups nearby m/z values into fixed-width windows and sums their intensities.
# 0.5 Da is appropriate for low-resolution QqQ instruments to account for m/z
# drift. Use a smaller value (e.g. 0.1) for higher-resolution instruments.
BIN_WIDTH = 0.5  # bin width in Da


# ── Filtering ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Removes uninformative features before statistics.
# Increase the percentile to remove more features; set to 0 to disable.
VARIANCE_PERCENTILE = 25  # remove bottom X% of features by variance (0 = off)
ABUNDANCE_PERCENTILE = 5  # remove bottom X% of features by abundance (0 = off)


# ── Normalization ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Corrects for differences in sample amount, injection volume, or instrument
# sensitivity between runs. Choose based on your experimental setup.
#
# Options:
#   'tic'      — divide each sample by its total ion current (sum of all
#                intensities) and rescale to the median TIC. The most common
#                approach for ambient MS and direct infusion experiments.
#                Default and recommended for LMJ-SSP data.
#
#   'median'   — divide each sample by its median feature intensity and rescale
#                to the global median. More robust than TIC when a small number
#                of very abundant features dominate the signal.
#
#   'pqn'      — Probabilistic Quotient Normalization. Compares each sample to
#                a reference spectrum (median of all samples) and estimates a
#                dilution factor. Handles sample-to-sample variation well.
#                Recommended if TIC gives poor results.
#
#   'quantile' — forces all samples to have the same intensity distribution.
#                Very aggressive normalization — use only if you are confident
#                that systematic distributional differences between samples are
#                technical, not biological.
#
#   'none'     — no normalization applied. Use only if your samples were
#                collected under strictly identical conditions and you trust
#                the raw signal intensities.
NORMALIZATION = 'tic'


# ── Transformation ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Log10 transformation compresses the wide dynamic range of MS data so that
# high-intensity features do not dominate the analysis.
# Options:
#   'log10'  — recommended for most MS metabolomics data (default)
#   'log2'   — similar to log10 but with base 2; common in transcriptomics
#   'sqrt'   — square root transform; gentler compression than log
#   'none'   — no transformation applied
LOG_TRANSFORM = 'log10'


# ── Scaling ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Scaling adjusts for differences in the magnitude of features so that all
# features contribute equally to the analysis regardless of their raw intensity.
#
# Van den Berg et al. (2006) compared scaling methods for metabolomics and found
# that autoscaling and range scaling best removed the dependence of feature
# rankings on average concentration. Choose based on your biological question:
#
#   'autoscale'  — subtract mean, divide by std dev. All features equally
#                  weighted. Best for comparing relative changes across features.
#                  Default and recommended for exploratory analysis.
#
#   'pareto'     — divide by square root of std dev. Large fold changes are
#                  reduced but the data is not made dimensionless. A compromise
#                  between autoscaling and no scaling.
#
#   'range'      — divide by the biological range (max - min). Scales features
#                  relative to their observed biological variation. Good when
#                  the biological range is meaningful.
#
#   'vast'       — variable stability scaling. Downweights features with high
#                  relative variation. Useful when you want to focus on stable,
#                  consistently-changing features.
#
#   'level'      — divide by the mean. Converts intensities to fold changes
#                  relative to the average. Useful for identifying biomarkers
#                  with large relative changes.
#
#   'none'       — no scaling applied. High-abundance features will dominate
#                  the analysis. Not recommended unless you have a specific reason.
SCALING = 'autoscale'


# ── PLS-DA ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Number of components for the PLS-DA scores plot.
# More components capture more variation but can overfit.
# 8 is a reasonable default for exploratory analysis.
# Note: VIP scores always use 1 component regardless of this setting.
